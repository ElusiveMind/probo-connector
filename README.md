# Open Probo.CI Continuous Collaboration Server - Drupal Module

This project provides a Drupal module for versions of Drupal 8.8.0 and higher including Drupal 9. It is designed with MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL back end database systems.

The purpose of this module is to act as a conduit and coordinator/communicator between Drupal, code repositories (Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab) and the Probo NodeJS server providing an interface for builds to users, managers and testers alike.

While this module can serve in a stand-alone capacity, it is meant as a companion piece to the ProboCI Open Source theme available at this [GitHub](https://github.com/ElusiveMind/probo-connector) repository.

To install, use composer.

`composer require mbagnall/probo-connector`

Any dependencies will be included as part of the package install. If you have any questions or are looking for documentation, refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/ElusiveMind/probo-connector/wiki) or view the documentation on the [Probo Documention Site](https://docs.probo.ci/).
